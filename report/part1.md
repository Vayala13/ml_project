# Introduction

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) (@1907.07496) is defined as way to measure the variation in time in between each heartbeat(@einstein) [^1].

# Part I (notes)

2.  Data attributes notes:

    Dataset is discrete because:

        - Integer values
        - The data collected by the watch is in intervals of integers (include watch details)

    Attribute is ratio because:

    - starts at the beats per minute required for survival (include the 26bpm world record)
    - _mention the zeros_

3.  Data set

    1. Heart rate variability, SDNN and apple watch: https://www.cultofmac.com/550061/apple-watch-heart-rate-variability/
    2. average SDNN https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109797005548
    3. Use case 1: sleep/wake classification using HRV: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00142
    4. Deep neural HRV analysis
    5. Very close to this project: Classification of Normal and Pathological Heart Signal Variability Using Machine Learning Techniques
