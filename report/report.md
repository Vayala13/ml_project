# Introduction

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a way to measure the variation in time in between each heartbeat (@hrvstanford). This variation is a measure of how the heart reacts to physical exercise, mental stress and heart diseases (@1907.07496). It has its origin on neurons from the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, and also by the vagus nerve. (hrv4training)

"In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress." - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5900369/

"Simply put, monitoring parasympathetic activity via HRV can provide insights on physiological stress, with higher level of stress resulting in lower HRV."

It has also become increasingly easier to have access to HRV data now that wearable devices become both capable of collecting such data and also more popular.
